# oop-chess
by Henry Bobeck

Quick chess remake from scratch using Java 1.8 & Eclipse in between summer trips; made to touch up on my object-oriented programming design process and increase familiarity of javax.swing graphics
Credit to JohnPablok for allowing fair use of his improved Cburnett chess set art
